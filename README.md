The Godot scene you'll want to be looking at is "machine.tscn" (it's currently programmed to open "main.tscn" in the project settings).

It may not be necessary to use the Pure Data files attached. However, if you want to use them then depending on your OS, you will need to download either the "current stable release" automatic installer for Windows or Macintosh OSX version, :

The Pure Data files attached are MOtest.pd (the one you use) and MOtestabs.pd (needs to be in the same folder as the other one).
